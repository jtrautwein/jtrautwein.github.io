            <p>I'm a student currently pursuing a degree in design, where I get to explore my creativity and develop my skills in a field that I'm passionate about. Design allows me to express myself and push the boundaries of my imagination. Outside of my studies, I deeply value spending time with my friends and family. They are my source of support, and I love the moments we share, whether it's simply relaxing together or going on adventures. Nature also holds a special place in my heart, especially flowers. I find peace and inspiration in the beauty of plants and the natural world. Whether I'm outdoors enjoying a walk or tending to my plants, I feel connected to the environment around me. These interests and relationships shape who I am and drive me to live a fulfilling and balanced life.<h3>
